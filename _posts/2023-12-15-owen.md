It may be cold where you are right now. Maybe wet and windy as well. South of the equator in sunny Brazil however, it's their summer ðŸŒž Here are some nice Brazilian bops I've acquired over the years. Mostly modern and classic bossa nova-y, carnival-y south American R&B and soul type stuff. Bom dia e eliz quinta feira!
