## 6 July 2023 - Richard W
First up is Take my Time from South African saxophonist Dennis Mpale. This is from Paying My Bills in 1994, which I would very loosely describe as ‘chilled out jazzy house’ - the whole album is great

and this is a very pleasing Japanese reggae take on Born Slippy from Sokabe Keiichi & Inokasira Rangers

I really like Tirzah and her stripped down sound, and she usually works with Mica Levi who wrote the creepy/brilliant for Under The Skin. This is Make It Up from 2015

fourth pick is Mohabbat by Arooj Aftab, which is properly beautiful. I saw her live a few weeks ago and it turns out that she’s hilarious as well as being an amazing artist

and last one, closing out on Transcendental Access Point by Eris Drew from a couple of years ago to end on something a bit euphoric. hope you enjoy!
